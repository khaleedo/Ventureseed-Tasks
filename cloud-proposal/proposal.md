Cloud Deployment Strategy for AI-Powered CLI Application

I propose deploying the AI CLI application using AWS ECS Fargate for serverless scalability. The containerized inference service would be stored in Amazon ECR and exposed via an API Gateway or Load Balancer for HTTP-based access from the CLI.

Auto-scaling policies will handle fluctuating demand, and CI/CD is handled using GitHub Actions, with updates deployed seamlessly to ECS. Terraform will manage all infrastructure. Monitoring and alerting will be configured using CloudWatch, and TLS certificates managed via ACM.

This setup supports rapid iteration, low latency, and a pay-as-you-go model suited for inference workloads.
